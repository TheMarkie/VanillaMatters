# Vanilla Matters
## A Mod for the Original Deus Ex

### Installation

#### For playing
1. Download the mod from the [release page](https://github.com/TheMarkie/VanillaMatters/releases).
2. Extract to your Deus Ex directory. The extracted folder, `VanillaMatters`, should be at: `<path to your game>/Deus Ex/VanillaMatters`.
3. Use `VanillaMatters.exe` inside `VanillaMatters/System` to play.

#### For modding
1. Follow the [setup guide here](https://github.com/TheMarkie/VanillaMatters/wiki/Setting-Up-Deus-Ex-for-modding). Make sure to get the utility scripts in the [Utilities section](https://github.com/TheMarkie/VanillaMatters/wiki/Setting-Up-Deus-Ex-for-modding#utilities).
2. Clone this repo somewhere, not required to be in your Deus Ex folder, and shouldn't be.  
3. Create a hardlink/directory junction inside your Deus Ex (or Deus Ex/VanillaMatters) folder with the corresponding name for every package in the repo.  
4. Now you're ready for modding. Simply use the batch scripts to compile, fork your own branch of Vanilla Matters if you want.
