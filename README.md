## A Mod for the Original Deus Ex

If you intend to use the mod for playing purposes, get it from the [official site](https://www.nexusmods.com/deusex/mods/56).

To install and use the code: 
1. Follow the [setup guide here](https://github.com/TheMarkie/VanillaMatters/wiki/Setting-Up-Deus-Ex-for-modding). Make sure to get the utility scripts in the [Utilities section](https://github.com/TheMarkie/VanillaMatters/wiki/Setting-Up-Deus-Ex-for-modding#utilities).
2. Clone this repo somewhere, not required to be in your Deus Ex folder, and shouldn't be.
3. If you haven't had a folder named "DeusEx" (no space) inside your Deus Ex folder, create an empty one, otherwise clean it up entirely.  
3b. Learn how to create hardlinks or directory junctions on the internet for your respective OS.
4. Create a hardlink/directory junction named Classes inside the DeusEx folder that corresponds to the folder Classes in the repo.  
4b. Do the same for Textures.
