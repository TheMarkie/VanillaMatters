    // VM: If the player walks out of the first circle, a second zone is established at the player's location, allowing the player to now harvest FP from up to TWO zones.
    // VM: If both zones are established, and the player walks into a position that's outside of BOTH current zones, then the first zone disappears and is replaced by this new zone.
